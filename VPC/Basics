VPC 
Virtual network inside AWS wiithin 1 account, 1 region and multi AZ. Private and isolated unless decided otherwise. Except default VPC. Regionally resilient
2 types:
- 1 default VPC per region (initially created by AWS, preconfigured, less flexible) 
- 0+ custom VPCs (can be configured like you want) 

VPC CIDR --> the IP address range VPC can use. 
Default VPC always use 172.31.0.0/16 

VPC can be divided into subnetworks
1 subnet in 1 AZ in each region. IP addresses of subnets cannot be the same and cannot overlap. 

Default VPC Facts:
- 0-1 per region (can be removed and recreated) 
- Default VPC CIDR 172.31.0.0/16 
- /20 subnet in each AZ in the region (# of subnets depend on # of AZ in region)
The higher the CIDR range /number is, the smaller the network
2 /17 will fit into /16
16 /20 will into /16
- provided with Internet Gateway, Security Group and NACL
- subnets assign public IPv4 addresses.
