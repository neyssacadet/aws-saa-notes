# Virtual Private Cloud Basics 
Regional isolated private network within AWS cloud that other private services can run from. 
Used to connect your AWS private networks to your on-premise networks when creating a hybrid environment. 
Used to connect to other cloud platforms for multi cloud deployment.

## Key Points 
Virtual network within AWS within 1 account and 1 region. Regionally resilient
Private and isolated unless decided otherwise (default) 

2 types of VPC :
- 0-1 Default VPC (created by AWS, preconfigured, handled by AWS, less flexible) 
- 0+ Custom VPCs 

## Default VPC 
Every VPC is allocated a range of IP --> VPC CIDR (range of IP addresses that VPC can use). Only 1 VPC CIDR (172.31.0.0/16) 

Each subnet located in 1 availability zone in that region. They cannot have overlapping or identical IP addresses. 
VPC resilient -> Deployed into region and split into subnets.

## Default VPC Facts 
- One per region - can be removed and recreated (A region can have 0 VPCs) 
- Always 172.31.0.0/16 as VPC CIDR 
- /20 subnet in each AZ in the region 
- The higher the CIDR /number is, the smaller the network is 
- Internet Gateway, Security Group and NACL
- Subnets assigned public IPv4 addresses
