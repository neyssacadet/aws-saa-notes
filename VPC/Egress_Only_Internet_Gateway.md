# Egress-Only Internet Gateway

Egress-Only internet gateways allow outbound communication only access to public AWS services and the public internet for IPv6 enabled instances or other VPC based services. Allows to send data to the internet while protecting from unsolicited inbound connections (security of VPC infrastructure enhanced!).
