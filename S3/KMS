# Key Managment Service (KMS) 
regional and public service (oocupies the AWS public zone) 
Create, store and manage keys (symmetric and assymmetric keys). Ability to perform cryptographic operations. Keys never leave KMS. Provides FIPS 140-2 (L2)

##assume symmetric keys 
KMS Keys are used within cryptographic operations. Contains ID, date, policy, desc and state. Backed by physical key material. Can be generated or imported. Can be used for up to 4kb
Stored in encrypted form. 

## Data Encryption Keys
Generated using GenerateDataKey operation to work on >4kb. 2 versions of key:
- plaintext version 
- ciphertext version 

Encrypts data using plaintext key then discards. Store encrypted key with data.

## Key Concepts 
KMS keys are isolated to a region and never leave 
AWS owned and customer owned 
AWS managed or customer managed Keys 
Cusomer managed keys are more configurable 
KMS keys support rotation 


## Key Policies and Security 
Key policies --> resource policy 
Every key has one.
